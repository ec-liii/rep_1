🐶🐱 Dog vs Cat Image Classification using CNN with GUI
This is a Deep Learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.
It includes:

A training notebook to build and save the model.
A GUI application using Tkinter to perform real-time classification on any image.
